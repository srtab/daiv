## Unreleased

### Added

- Added support to `github` client type to allow users to use GitHub as the client for the codebase.
- Added to `PlanAndExecuteAgent` the capability to:
  - load images from the user message to help the agent to visualize them (using `InjectImagesMiddleware`).
  - plan and execute commands using the DAIV Sandbox tools. This will allow the agent to perform actions on the codebase, such as installing/updating dependencies ensuring lock files are updated, generating translations, etc.
  - load the repository instructions from a `AGENTS.md` file, which is a markdown file that follows the [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) format.
- Added `InjectImagesMiddleware` LangChain v1 middleware to automatically extract and process images from markdown/HTML syntax in user messages, supporting GitHub user-attachments, GitLab uploads, and external URLs.
- Added `AGENTS.md` file to the project.
- Added `omit_content_patterns` to DAIV configuration to allow users to omit files content, but visible for the agents (the agent will only be able to see that the file exists, but not its content).
- Added evaluation tests for `CodebaseChatAgent`, `PullRequestDescriberAgent` and `PlanAndExecuteAgent`.
- Added support to `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-nano`, `gpt-5-mini` and `gpt-5-codex` models from OpenAI.
- Added support to `grok-code-fast-1` model from Grok.
- Added support to `claude-sonnet-4.5`, `claude-opus-4.1` and `claude-haiku-4.5` models from Anthropic.
- Added support to `deepseek-v3.1-terminus` model from DeepSeek.
- Added support to `glm-4.6` model from Z-AI.
- Added support to `qwen3-max` and `qwen3-coder-plus` models from Qwen.
- Added `pipeline` and `job_logs` tools to allow `PlanAndExecuteAgent` agent to fix pipelines by retrieving the pipeline status and job logs when planning.
- Added `diff` tool to allow the `PlanAndExecuteAgent` executor to retrieve unified diffs showing only changed lines instead of rereading entire files, reducing token consumption by up to 98% for large files with small changes.
- Added `RECURSION_LIMIT` configuration to `CodebaseChatAgent` to allow users to change the limit of recursive calls to the agent.

### Changed

- Migrated LangChain and LangGraph to v1.x with updated imports and API patterns.
- Improved planning prompt of `PlanAndExecuteAgent` to deal better with asking for clarification, ensuring the agent will ask questions contextualized to the current state of the codebase.
- Changed `CodebaseChatAgent` to only be able to answer questions about a repository at a time by passing the repository id as a header. This is direct consequence of removing codebase indexation, making it difficult to answer questions about multiple repositories at the same time. **BREAKING CHANGE**
- Changed `PullRequestDescriberAgent` to use diffs to describe the changes instead of commit messages, making it more accurate and concise.
- Replaced repository read tools `search_code_snippets`, `retrieve_file_content`, and `repository_structure` with the new `glob`, `grep`, `ls`, and `read` tools.
- Replaced repository write tools `create_new_repository_file`, `replace_snippet_in_file`, `rename_repository_file` and `delete_repository_file` with the new `write`, `edit`, `delete` and `rename` tools.
- Replaced sandbox tools `run_sandbox_commands` and `run_sandbox_code` with the new `bash` tool.
- Replaced LLM-based image extraction in `PlanAndExecuteAgent` with regex-based utility function for improved performance and reduced costs.
- Migrated default database from `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` to `postgres:17.6`.
- Migrated project from Python 3.13 to Python 3.14.
- Refactored repository configuration file schema to be more flexible and easier to use. **BREAKING CHANGE**
- Moved tools from `daiv/automation/tools` to `daiv/automation/agents/tools`.
- Moved quick actions from `daiv/automation/quick_actions` to `daiv/quick_actions`.
- Migrated quick action `help` to activate as `@daiv /help` instead of `@daiv help`. **BREAKING CHANGE**
- Migrated quick action `plan execute` to activate as `@daiv /approve-plan` instead of `@daiv plan execute`. **BREAKING CHANGE**
- Migrated quick action `plan revise` to activate as `@daiv /revise-plan` instead of `@daiv plan revise`. **BREAKING CHANGE**
- Updated project dependencies.
- Updated documentation.

### Fixed

- Blocked GitLab and GitHub callbacks if client type is not set to the corresponding client.
- Fixed `PlanAndExecuteAgent` to avoid reading the same files twice before executing the planned changes.
- Fixed `write` and `rename` tools to create parent directories automatically when they don't exist, preventing `FileNotFoundError`.
- Fixed sandbox session management to properly reuse sessions across multiple `bash` tool invocations by replacing ContextVar-based storage with LangGraph store-based persistence.
- Fixed DuckDuckGo search tool to use the new `ddgs` package instead of the deprecated `duckduckgo-search` package.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-25

### Added

- Added quick actions feature to allow users perform actions by commenting on the merge request or issue.
- Added quick actions to allow users to trigger plan revision by commenting `@daiv plan revise` on the issue.

### Changed

- Migrated `RunSandboxCommandsTool` and `RunSandboxCodeTool` to be async only.

- Migrated `IssueAddressorAgent` plan approval to be triggered by a quick action, allowing users to request a plan approval by commenting `@daiv plan execute` on the issue.

### Fixed

- `ReviewAddressorAgent` was not handling single line notes without line range, leading to empty diff content.
- `IssueAddressorAgent` was not handling correctly issues with the bot label on the title, leading to errors. Now it will remove the bot label from the title. #435
- Mentions to the bot on the review comments were not being handled correctly, leading the agent to ask for clarification about who is being mentioned in this context. #436

## [0.1.5] - 2025-05-26

### Added

- Added `cleanup_indexes` command to clean up outdated indexes and inaccessible repositories.

### Fixed

- Fixed connection closed or lost on `ConnectionPool` by using `check_connection` to verify if the connection is still working.

### Added

- Added mapping for `yaml` language for `.yaml` and `.yml` extensions.

### Fixed

- Temperature is being sent on `o4-mini` model, which is not supported.

- Updated project urls declared in `pyproject.toml` to use standard labels.
- Updated sensible `pydantic` settings to use `SecretStr` to avoid exposing sensitive information.

### Fixed

- Turned Sandbox tools more resilient and prevent failing the whole agent execution when the sandbox is unavailable.
- Empty repositories case was not being considered on the repository structure tool, causing an not found error.
