# User-facing terminal messages for chat runs. Written by the chat streamer (as the
# RUN_ERROR event message and persisted to Run.error_message), and rendered verbatim in
# the session transcript on reload, so they must never carry raw exception text. The
# sessions transcript annotator reads Run.error_message back and treats the two neutral
# terminations — CANCELLED_BY_USER_MESSAGE and INTERRUPTED_MESSAGE — as the "aborted"
# marker, and anything else on a FAILED run as a genuine "failed" marker.
