Your goal is to determine the root cause of the failure and categorize whether the issue is directly related to the codebase or caused by external factors.

Please follow these instructions carefully to complete your analysis:
1. Analyze the output focusing on:
   - Error messages;
   - Unexpected behavior or output;
   - Failed command or script execution;
   - Resource issues (e.g., memory, CPU, disk space);
   - Timing problems or timeouts.

2. Ignore any warnings, as they are irrelevant for the failure of the pipeline.

3. Determine the root cause of the failure. Consider common issues such as:
   - Code compilation errors;
   - Test failures;
   - Dependency installation errors;
   - Configuration issues;
   - Infrastructure or environment problems;
   - Code quality errors.

3. Categorize the identified issue as either:
   a. Directly related to the codebase that can be solved by a commit: Issues that stem from the application code, tests, code quality, or project-specific configurations.
   b. Caused by external factors: Issues related to the CI/CD environment, infrastructure, or third-party services.

Before providing your final analysis, wrap your analysis inside <log_analysis> tags to show your thought process for each step. This will help ensure a thorough interpretation of the data. Include the following steps:

1. List all error messages from the output you identified on the first step.
2. Use the diff to identify what changes have been made that may have directly caused the problem. Skip this step if not relevant.
3. List potential causes for each error message.
4. Evaluate whether each potential cause is code-related or external.

After your analysis, provide your findings using the available tool.""")  # noqa: E501

1. First, review the provided job logs:
<job_logs>
{{ job_logs }}
</job_logs>

2. Next, review the changes that were applied to the codebase extracted from the merge request diff:
<diff>
{{ diff }}
</diff>

3. Analyze the error log:
   - Identify the specific error messages and their locations in the code.
   - Look for any stack traces or line numbers that point to the source of the error.
   - Pay attention to any formatting or linting tool diffs that may be present in the error log.

4. Identify the root cause:
   - Based on the error messages and the codebase, determine the likely cause of the pipeline failure.
   - Consider whether the issue is related to syntax errors, logical errors, or configuration problems.

5. Apply changes to the codebase according to the instructions provided:
   - If the error log contains formatting or linting tool diffs, apply these changes first.
   - Make any additional necessary changes to fix the identified root cause.
   - Ensure that your changes are minimal and targeted to address the specific issue.
   - IMPORTANT: Before making any changes, determine if you need to use tools to obtain the latest version of any files that will be modified. Do not assume file content based solely on the diff or job log provided.

6. Verify the fix:
   - Review your changes and ensure they address the root cause without introducing new issues.
   - Consider any potential side effects of your changes and mitigate them if necessary.

### Instructions ###
1. **Analyze the Root Cause**
   Wrap your analysis in `<root_cause_breakdown>` tags. Within these tags:
   - **(a)** Identify the **main issues** found in the root cause analysis.
   - **(b)** **Quote** the relevant parts of the root cause analysis that support each issue.
   - **(c)** **Prioritize** these issues based on their **impact** and **urgency**.
   - **(d)** Use the available tools to inspect relevant parts of the codebase for each issue, and **document** key findings.
   - **(e)** **Brainstorm** 2-3 actionable steps to address each issue, referencing what you've learned from the code.
   - **(f)** Note any **potential challenges or limitations** for each proposed step.
   - **(g)** **Estimate** the impact and effort required for each solution.
   - **(h)** **Summarize** your overall approach and **justify** how you prioritized the issues.

2. **Create the Action Plan**
   - Based on your root cause analysis, present a **structured plan** to fix the identified issues.
   - Provide **clear, sequential** steps, with **technical details** where appropriate.
   - Ensure each step **directly addresses** a specific issue.

3. **Formatting & Clarity**
   - Use concise language and appropriate **Markdown** (e.g., headers, bullet points, code blocks).
   - Reference **specific code segments** (files, functions, etc.) if your inspections reveal anything noteworthy.

Begin your response with the `<root_cause_breakdown>` section. Conclude by calling the `{{ action_plan_output_tool }}` tool with your detailed action plan.""",  # noqa: E501
