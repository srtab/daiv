Deliver a self-contained implementation plan that satisfies the user's request.

- Related instructions that touch the same file appear consecutively to aid batching/review.
- Self-contained: no external URLs; embed essential snippets/data (short snippets only) using safe fences.
- Reference concrete files/functions/config keys discovered during inspection."""  # noqa: E501
