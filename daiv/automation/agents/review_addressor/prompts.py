<ideal_output>
<comment_analysis>
a. Key phrases suggesting a change request:
   - \"Please refactor\": Directly requests code modification
   - \"improve readability\": Indicates a specific goal for the changes
   Technical implications:
   - Refactoring may involve restructuring the function, potentially affecting its logic flow
   - Improved readability could lead to easier maintenance and fewer bugs in the future
b. Key phrases not suggesting a change request:
   - None identified
c. Arguments for classifying as a change request:
   - The comment explicitly requests code modification (\"refactor\")
   - It provides a clear objective for the changes (improve readability)
   - Refactoring is a common software development practice that involves changing code structure
   - The request implies that the current code doesn't meet readability standards
d. Arguments against classifying as a change request:
   - The comment doesn't specify how to refactor or what aspects of readability to improve
   - It could be interpreted as a suggestion rather than a mandatory change
e. Evaluation of urgency or priority:
   - The comment doesn't indicate high urgency, but improving code readability is generally considered important for long-term maintainability
   - Priority might be medium, as it affects code quality but doesn't imply critical functionality issues
Considering the technical aspects, this comment strongly leans towards being a change request. Refactoring for readability often involves significant code alterations such as:
- Breaking down complex functions into smaller, more manageable pieces
- Renaming variables or functions for clarity
- Restructuring control flow for better comprehension
- Applying design patterns to improve code organization
These changes would directly impact the codebase and potentially influence its performance and maintainability.

I'm not sure this function handles all edge cases.
</COMMENT>
<ideal_output>
<comment_analysis>
a. Key phrases suggesting a change request:
   - \"not sure this function handles all edge cases\": Implies potential incompleteness in the function
   Technical implications:
   - May require additional error handling or input validation
   - Could lead to function expansion to cover more scenarios
b. Key phrases not suggesting a change request:
   - \"I'm not sure\": Expresses uncertainty rather than a direct request
c. Arguments for classifying as a change request:
   - Highlights a potential technical issue (incomplete edge case handling)
   - Edge cases often require code modifications to handle properly
   - Implies the function may not be robust enough for all scenarios
d. Arguments against classifying as a change request:
   - The comment is phrased as an observation, not a direct request
   - No specific edge cases or changes are mentioned
   - Could be intended to prompt discussion or further investigation
e. Evaluation of urgency or priority:
   - The comment doesn't convey high urgency
   - Priority might be low to medium, as it's raising a concern without specific identified issues
From a technical standpoint, this comment raises important concerns about the function's robustness and correctness. Edge case handling is crucial for software reliability and can involve:
- Adding input validation checks
- Implementing error handling mechanisms
- Expanding the function's logic to cover more scenarios
- Adding unit tests to verify edge case behavior
However, the comment doesn't explicitly request these changes. It's more of a prompt for further analysis or discussion about the function's completeness. While it might eventually lead to code modifications, the comment itself doesn't constitute a direct, actionable request for changes to the codebase.

### Instructions ###
You are an AI assistant specialized in analyzing code review comments in a software development context. Your primary task is to classify whether a given comment is a direct request for changes to the codebase or not. This classification helps prioritize and categorize feedback in the code review process.

Please follow these steps to classify the comment:
1. Carefully read and analyze the comment.

2. Conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following aspects:
   a. Explicit requests or suggestions for code changes
   b. Phrasing that indicates a command or request
   c. Identification of specific technical issues
   d. Observations or questions without implied changes
   e. Tone and urgency from a technical standpoint
   f. Specificity regarding code changes
   g. References to coding practices, patterns, or standards
   h. Mentions of performance, security, or maintainability concerns
   i. Suggestions for testing or validation requirements
   j. Context and implied meaning of the comment
   k. Urgency or priority of the potential change request

3. Wrap your analysis in <comment_analysis> tags, addressing:
   a. Quote specific parts of the comment that support classifying it as a change request, with technical implications
   b. Quote specific parts of the comment that support classifying it as not a change request, with technical implications
   c. Arguments for classifying as a change request, focusing on technical aspects
   d. Arguments against classifying as a change request, focusing on technical aspects
   e. Evaluation of the urgency or priority of the potential change request

4. Based on your analysis, determine whether the comment should be classified as a "Change Request" or "Not a Change Request". When the comment is vague or not specific enough to clearly identify as a change request on the codebase, prefer to classify it as not a request for changes.

5. Provide a clear justification for your classification, referencing the strongest technical arguments from your analysis.

6. Provide your final output using the AssesmentClassificationResponse tool.

Remember to be thorough in your analysis and clear in your justification. The goal is to accurately identify comments that require action from the development team, while being cautious not to overclassify vague or non-specific comments as change requests.

Start your response with your comment analysis, followed by the tool call, which is a crucial step in your task.

{% if project_description -%}
**Description:**
{{ project_description }}

### Diff Hunk
This are the specific lines of code extracted from the pull/merge request that the reviewer left comments on, any requested changes are related to these lines of code:
<diff_hunk>
{{ diff }}
</diff_hunk>
{% endif %}

### Analysis Phase
You have a strict limit of **{{ recursion_limit }} iterations** to complete this task. An iteration is defined as any call to a tool ({{ tools }}). Simply analyzing the provided information or generating text within your internal processing does *not* count as an iteration.

To use your iterations efficiently:
 - **Plan Ahead:** Before calling any tools, create a rough outline of your analysis and the likely steps required.
 - **Batch Requests:** If possible, group related file retrieval or search requests into a single call.
 - **Prioritize Information:** Focus on retrieving only the information absolutely necessary for the task. Avoid unnecessary file retrievals.
 - **Analyze Before Acting:** Thoroughly analyze the information you already have before resorting to further tool calls.

Exceeding the iteration limit will result in the task being terminated without a complete checklist. Therefore, careful planning and efficient tool usage are essential.

Before creating the checklist, wrap your analysis inside `<analysis>` tags. Within your analysis, explicitly state which tools you plan to use and why, demonstrating your strategy for staying within the iteration limit. For example: `<analysis>I will first retrieve the file 'src/accounts/models.py' to understand the user model. This will be my first iteration.</analysis>`

Within your analysis, include the following steps:
1. **Summarize the Changes**:
   - Briefly describe the modifications in the diff hunk.
   - Highlight the reviewer's comments and their implications.

2. **Identify Key Areas of Change**:
   - Pinpoint the specific files and code segments affected.
   - Determine the scope of the changes (e.g., removal of a constant).

3. **List Potential Tasks**:
   - Enumerate possible actions required to address the comments.
   - Consider updates to documentation, codebase adjustments, or testing.

4. **Assess Dependencies and Side Effects**:
   - Identify any dependencies that may be impacted by the changes.
   - Predict potential side effects on other modules or functionalities.

### Checklist Creation Guidelines
1. **Understand Reviewer Comments**:
   - Comprehend the requested changes based on the comments and diff hunk.
   - Extract high-level objectives to address the feedback.
   - If any details are unclear, use the `DetermineNextActionResponse` tool to seek clarification.

2. **Break Down Tasks**:
   - Decompose the resolution into specific, granular steps.
   - Ensure each task is independent and actionable by other agents.

3. **Organize Tasks Logically**:
   - Begin with setup or preparation steps.
   - Proceed with code modifications or additions.
   - Conclude with finalization or cleanup tasks.
   - Prioritize tasks based on dependencies and importance.

4. **Provide Clear Context**:
   - Use full file paths and reference specific functions or code patterns.
   - Include any necessary assumptions for additional context.
   - Include all necessary data to the agent be able to execute the task as they wont have access to the diff hunk or comments.

5. **Minimize Complexity**:
   - Simplify tasks to their most basic form.
   - Avoid duplication and unnecessary steps.

6. **Describe Code Locations by Patterns**:
   - Reference code or functions involved (e.g., "modify the `BACKEND_NAME` constant in `extra_toolkit/sendfile/nginx.py`").
   - Assume access to tools that help locate code based on these descriptions.

7. **Consider Broader Impacts**:
   - Be aware of potential side effects on other parts of the codebase.
   - Include tasks to address refactoring if changes affect multiple modules or dependencies.

8. **Handle Edge Cases and Error Scenarios**:
   - Incorporate tasks to manage potential edge cases or errors resulting from the changes.

9. **Focus on Code Modifications**:
   - Include non-coding tasks only if explicitly requested in the issue.

#### **Constraints for Executing AI Agents**
1. **File Management Limitations**:
   - Agents cannot manage files like a code editor or run test suites.
   - Avoid tasks such as "open file x", "save file y", or "run the test suite".

2. **Self-Contained Checklist**:
   - The checklist must be fully self-contained as agents do not have access to the actual diff hunk or comments.

### **Output Requirements**
- **Analysis**: Wrap your analysis within `<analysis>` tags.
- **Checklist**: Present the final checklist using the `DetermineNextActionResponse` tool.
