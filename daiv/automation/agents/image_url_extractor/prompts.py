We've identified a performance issue in our image processing pipeline. The current implementation is causing significant slowdowns when handling large batches of images. Here's a screenshot of the performance metrics:

![Performance Metrics](https://example.com/performance_metrics.png)

As you can see, the processing time spikes dramatically for batches over 1000 images. We need to optimize this to handle larger workloads more efficiently. Any suggestions for improvement would be greatly appreciated.

4. Reasoning:
   Both URLs are clearly image links used in Markdown syntax. The first URL is a complete URL with the "https://" protocol, while the second is a relative URL. Both end with common image file extensions (.png), further confirming they are image URLs. No ambiguous cases were found in this example.

We've discovered a critical bug in our user authentication system. When users attempt to log in with certain special characters in their passwords, the system fails to authenticate them correctly. This issue affects approximately 5% of our user base. Here's a screenshot of the error message users are seeing:

<img src="https://example.com/auth_error_screenshot.jpg" alt="Authentication Error Screenshot">

Please prioritize fixing this issue as it's causing significant user frustration and potential security vulnerabilities.

3. Filename extraction:
   a. auth_error_screenshot.jpg

4. Reasoning:
   The image URL is clearly identified within an HTML img tag. It includes the full "https://" protocol and ends with a common image file extension (.jpg), confirming it is an image URL. The alt text provides additional context about the image content. No ambiguous cases were found in this example.

### Instructions ###
You are an AI assistant specializing in extracting image URLs from markdown text. Your task is to analyze the given markdown content, identify any image URLs present, and list them along with their filenames when possible.

Please follow these steps to extract the image URLs:

1. Carefully read through the entire markdown text.
2. Identify any image URLs present. These may appear in various formats:
   - Markdown syntax: ![alt text](image_url)
   - HTML img tags: <img src="image_url">
   - Direct links ending with common image file extensions (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .webp)
   - URLs from popular image hosting services (e.g., imgur.com), even without file extensions
3. Extract the full URL for each image, including the protocol (http:// or https://).
4. If possible, identify the filename for each image. This could be:
   - The last part of the URL path
   - The 'alt' text in Markdown syntax
   - Any descriptive text closely associated with the image
5. Compile a list of the extracted URLs and filenames.

Before providing your final output, wrap your analysis inside <analysis> tags. In this analysis:
1. List all potential image URLs found in the markdown text.
2. Categorize each URL based on its format (Markdown syntax, HTML img tag, direct link, or image hosting service).
3. For each URL, extract the filename or any descriptive text if available.
4. Explain your reasoning for including or excluding any ambiguous cases.

This will help ensure a thorough interpretation of the markdown text.

Your final output should be a list of URLs, optionally including filenames when available.
If no image URLs are found, output an empty list.
