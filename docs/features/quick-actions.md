# ‚ö° Quick Actions

Quick Actions provide command-based interactions with DAIV directly from issues and merge/pull requests. They are useful for common tasks and information requests.

---

## Overview

Quick Actions are triggered by mentioning DAIV with specific commands in issue or merge/pull request comments.

### How Quick Actions Work

**Command Format**: `@<daiv-username> <action> [arguments]`

**Supported Scopes**:

- **Issues**: Available in issue comments and discussions
- **Merge/Pull Requests**: Available in merge/pull request comments and discussions

**Command Parsing**:

Quick Actions use shell-like parsing with support for:

- **Simple commands**: `@daiv help`
- **Commands with sub-actions**: `@daiv plan execute`, `@daiv pipeline repair`
- **Multi-word sub-actions**: `@daiv pipeline repair apply`
- **Case-insensitive**: `@DAIV HELP` works the same as `@daiv help`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Action not recognized**:

- Check that the action supports the current scope (issue vs merge/pull request)
- Ensure proper spelling and case (actions are case-insensitive)
- Verify sub-action syntax (e.g., `plan execute` not `plan-execute`)

**No response from DAIV**:

- Confirm DAIV has access to the repository
- Check that webhooks are properly configured
- Verify the bot username is correct in the mention

**Permission errors**:

- Ensure DAIV has sufficient repository permissions
- Confirm the user triggering the action has appropriate access levels

**Pipeline action issues**:

- Ensure the pipeline is in "failed" status
- Check that failed jobs have `script_failure` as the failure reason
- Verify jobs are not marked as `allow_failure`

**Plan action issues**:

- Ensure you're commenting on an issue (not merge/pull request)
- Check if there's an existing plan to execute or revise

### Debug Information

Quick Actions log detailed information for troubleshooting:

- Command parsing results
- Registry lookup attempts
- Execution success/failure
- Error details and stack traces

## Examples

### Getting Help

```
@daiv help
```

**Response**:
```
### ü§ñ DAIV Quick-Actions
Comment one of the commands below on this issue to trigger the bot:

- `@daiv help` - Shows the help message with the available quick actions.
- `@daiv plan execute` - Run or launch the current plan.
- `@daiv plan revise` - Discard current plan and create a new one from scratch.
```

## Extension and Development

### Adding New Actions

1. **Create** new action class in `automation/quick_actions/actions/`
2. **Implement** required methods `execute_action` and `actions`
3. **Decorate** with `@quick_action` specifying verb and scopes
4. **Import** in the actions module
5. **Test** the action in development environment

### Best Practices

- **Keep actions simple**: Quick Actions should execute immediately
- **Provide clear descriptions**: Help users understand what each action does
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Post user-friendly error messages
- **Use appropriate scopes**: Only enable actions where they make sense
- **Follow naming conventions**: Use clear, descriptive verb names
