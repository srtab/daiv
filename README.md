DAIV is an open-source automation assistant designed to enhance developer productivity. It integrates seamlessly with **GitLab** and **GitHub** repositories to streamline your development process. It uses AI agents and configurable actions to automate common software development tasks such as:

- **Issue Addressing**: Planning and, after human approval, executing solutions directly from issue titles and descriptions.
- **Code Review Assistance**: Automatically responding to reviewer comments, adjusting code, repairing failed CI/CD pipelines and improving pull requests on demand.

## Key Features

- 🚀 **Automated Issue Resolution**: When an issue is created in your repository, DAIV can parse the description, propose a step-by-step plan, and, after human approval, execute code changes and open a merge request for you to review.
- 💬 **Code Review Addressor**: Assists with code review comments by providing context-aware answers or directly applying requested changes. This reduces the overhead of going back and forth on merge requests.
- 🧠 **Codebase Chat**: Chat with your codebase for context-aware answers. An OpenAI-compatible API is available for easy integration with tools such as [Open-WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui).
- ⚙️ **Configurable Behavior**: A `.daiv.yml` file in your repo's default branch lets you tailor DAIV's features (like toggling auto-issue addressing).
- ⚡ **Quick Actions**: Command-based interactions for common tasks on issues and merge requests, such as regenerating plan, approving plan, repairing pipeline, etc.
- 🔧 **MCP Tools**: Supporting [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) tools to extend the capabilities of the agents.
- 📦 **Sandbox**: Running commands in a secure sandbox to allow the agents to perform actions on the codebase, such as installing/updating dependencies, generating translations, etc. with your own docker image.
- 📊 **Monitoring**: Monitoring the behavior of the agents to allow you to analyze the performance and identify potential issues.
- 🤖 **Providers Support**: [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/api), [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini) and [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) are the supported LLM providers.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for building robust APIs and managing database models.
- **Async Tasks**: [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/) with Redis, applying actions in the background and scaling the agents to handle multiple requests.
- **LLM Frameworks**: [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) and [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph), integrating various LLM agents for intent understanding, query transformation, and natural language reasoning about code changes.
- **Code Executor**: [Sandbox](https://github.com/srtab/daiv-sandbox/) for running commands in a secure sandbox to allow the agents to perform actions on the codebase.
- **Observability**: [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) for tracing and monitoring all the interactions between DAIV and your codebase.
- **Error Handling**: [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for tracking and analyzing errors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose**

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srtab/daiv.git
   cd daiv
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   Copy `docker/local/app/config.secrets.env.example` to `docker/local/app/config.secrets.env` and update it with your Git platform credentials (GitLab token or GitHub App credentials), OpenAI API Key, Anthropic API Key, Gemini API Key, and LangSmith API Key.

   ```bash
   cp docker/local/app/config.secrets.env.example docker/local/app/config.secrets.env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies** (optional):
   We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage dependencies on DAIV.

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > This will install the project dependencies into a virtual environment. Useful for running linting outside of Docker or enabling autocompletion in VSCode.

4. **Start the Server**:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   This will start all needed services locally. You can access them at:

   - DAIV API documentation: https://localhost:8000/api/docs/
   - PGAdmin (database management): http://localhost:8080
   - GitLab (local test repository platform): http://localhost:8929
   - Sandbox (secure code execution): http://localhost:8888/docs

   > [!NOTE]
   > The local development setup includes a GitLab instance for testing. For GitHub integration, you'll need to use GitHub.com or your own GitHub Enterprise instance.

5. **Run the tests** (optional):
   DAIV includes a comprehensive test suite. To run tests with coverage:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose exec -it app bash
   $ make test
   ```

6. **Run linting** (optional):
   To ensure code quality:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose exec -it app bash
   $ make lint      # to check for linting issues
   $ make lint-fix  # to automatically fix linting errors
   ```

7. **Configure test repository**:
   To be able to test DAIV, you need to configure a test repository on the local GitLab instance (or use your own GitHub repository).

   1. First you need to obtain root password to authenticate with [local GitLab](http://localhost:8929):

      ```bash
      $ docker compose exec -it gitlab grep 'Password:' /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password
      ```

   2. Then you need to configure a personal access token (you can use the root user or create a new user) and add it to the `docker/local/app/config.secrets.env` file.

   3. Now you need to create a new project in GitLab and follow the instructions to push your testing code to it.

      > [!TIP]
      > You can import using repository URL, go to `Admin Area` -> `Settings` -> `General` -> `Import and export settings` and check the `Repository by URL` option.

   4. After you push/import your code to the repository, you need to set up webhooks and index the repository in DAIV:

      ```bash
      # Enter the app container
      $ docker compose exec -it app bash

      # Set up webhooks to trigger automatically DAIV actions. You can disable SSL verification for local development by adding `--disable-ssl-verification` to the command.
      $ django-admin setup_webhooks

      # Update the repository index to be able to search for code
      $ django-admin update_index
      ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > If you're getting the error `Invalid url given` when setting up the webhooks on local GitLab, go to `Admin Area` -> `Settings` -> `Network` -> `Outbound requests` and check the `Allow requests to the local network from webhooks and integrations` option.

   5. Finally, you can test DAIV by creating an issue in your repository, add `daiv` label to it and see how DAIV will automatically present a plan to address the issue.
