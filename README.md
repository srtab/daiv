# DAIV

DAIV (Developer's AI Assistant and Virtual Engineer) is an AI-driven tool designed to enhance the productivity and efficiency of development teams using GitLab or GitHub (comming soon). By automating critical aspects of the development process, DAIV empowers teams to focus on innovation and high-level problem-solving while leaving routine tasks to intelligent automation.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automated Code Review Management**

DAIV streamlines the code review process by automatically addressing feedback left by other developers. If a review note is ambiguous or unclear, DAIV will intelligently ask follow-up questions to clarify the request. Once the necessary information is obtained, DAIV will implement the requested changes and close the discussion, ensuring a seamless code review experience.

### 2. **Issue-Driven Code Implementation (WIP)**

DAIV takes issue management to the next level by acting as a virtual software engineer. When a new issue is created, DAIV automatically analyzes the story or task described and attempts to implement the required code. This feature accelerates development timelines and reduces the workload on human developers by handling routine coding tasks autonomously.

### 3. **Automated Pipeline Fixes (comming soon)**

Pipeline failures can be time-consuming and frustrating. DAIV mitigates this by analyzing pipeline errors, identifying the root cause, and implementing fixes autonomously. Whether it's a failing unit test or a broken integration, DAIV will strive to resolve the issue, minimizing downtime and keeping the CI/CD pipeline running smoothly.

## Target Audience

DAIV is designed for development teams of all sizes and industries that utilize GitLab or GitHub for code versioning. Whether you're part of a small startup or a large enterprise, DAIV can help streamline your development process, reduce bottlenecks, and improve overall team productivity.

## Technology Stack

DAIV is built using a robust stack of modern technologies:

- **Django**: The backbone of DAIV, providing a scalable and secure framework for building the application's backend.
- **OpenAI**: Powers the AI-driven functionalities, enabling DAIV to understand and process natural language inputs, generate code, and interact intelligently with users.
- **LangChain**: Enhances DAIV's ability to chain together complex AI-driven tasks, allowing for more sophisticated and multi-step automation processes.
- **ChromaDB**: A vector database that supports DAIV's data retrieval and similarity search capabilities through codebases.
- **Tantivy**: A high-performance search engine library that DAIV uses to quickly and accurately search through codebases.

## Getting Started

_This section is currently a work in progress (WIP). More information on setup, installation, and configuration will be provided soon._
